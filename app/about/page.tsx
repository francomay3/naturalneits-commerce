        Hi! I'm Natasha. I sew everything you see here. By hand, at home, often
        with a cup of tea nearby and my little one playing at my feet.
      </p>
      <p>
        This shop grew out of a quiet dream: to make simple, beautiful things
        that last. Clothes you can wear every day, made from natural fabrics.
        Pieces that feel like home. I take inspiration from the countryside
        around us. The slow days, the changing seasons, the way things used to
        be made.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every garment, every stitch, is done with care. No factories, no
        shortcuts. Just me, my sewing machine, and a deep love for the craft.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for being here. I hope you find something that feels just
        right.
